        <p class="myself">I'm a 16 year old programmer which has been coding for about 2 and half years. I live in Poland but can speak Advanced English as I spent 8 years living in England. I decided to start my journey buy joining free online classes and learning the basics of HTML. From then I decided that I want to expand my knowlege and try out other lanugages. I then started learning Python, I created many projects by using YouTube tutorials and my knowlege. I then moved onto more advanced Python and started learning about Classes,Game Making, Functions and more. I have been coding Python for about 1 and a half years. Through out the years I was also learning how to make Websites, Animations, and Functions of HTML. I also got to experience a bit of JavaScript and created Calculator,Websites,Animations,Games. I'm now confident that I can create a website by my self with no problems. I then decided that I want to learn some C++ as it is a intresting laungage and after a year of playing around with it I can also make programs like Bank-Application,Library,Files. C++ is also my stronges laungage as I feel confident in writing it.</p>
